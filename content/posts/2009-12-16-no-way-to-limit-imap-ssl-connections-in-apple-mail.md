Such an annoying problem, especially for connecting to GMail via IMAP.  I constantly get the error: Too many simultaneous connections.  The worst part is this has been known ever since Leopard shipped:

Any fix, Apple?

**UPDATE**

This problem seems to date much further back then Leopard.  I've found references to this same issue in late 2003 (v10.3!!), here:

Unfortunately, I don't have access to server configuration as my problem is with GMail.  It seems like Apple may never fix this.
