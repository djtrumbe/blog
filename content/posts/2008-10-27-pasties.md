Below is the recipe for a Cornish pasty from Grandma Trumbell that my Mom has been making for years. Because I now live in London and this recipe was created in the US, the recipe is still in the works for all you UK residents.

Crust:

  * 1 cup of plain flour
  * 1/3 cup of Trex (or 1/3 cup of Crisco)
  * 1/3 tsp of table salt
  * 1/4 cup of ice cold water

Mix flour, shortening and salt, then add water gradually until dough holds together. Split the dough in 2, then roll into a circle on floured surface.

Filling:

  * 2 medium potatoes
  * 2 medium carrots
  * 1/4 of a medium onion
  * 1/3 lb of ground beef
  * salt and pepper to taste

Mix all filling ingredients thoroughly. Split filling and place 1/2 on each pasty crust. Situate the filling to 1/2 of the round crust. Next place 2 thin pats of butter on top of the filling as well as the salt and pepper. Dab cold water to the edge of 1/2 of the crust, then flip the empty half over and press the 2 edges together. It will look like a half circle at this point. Dab more cold water on the edge and crimp the bottom to the top.

Bake at 200 degrees C (400 degrees F) for 1 hour.

Makes 2 pasties.
