One of our favorite foods is hummus.  After returning from Israel I was on a mission to find the best hummus recipe.  The only tool you need to make hummus is either a food processor or hand blender.  You could use a normal blender for this, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Here's my work in progress:

  * 1 can of chick peas
  * 2 to 3 tbsp liquid from drained chick peas
  * Juice from 1 lemon
  * 1/3 cup tahini
  * 1 to 2 cloves garlic (or 1 to 2 tsp garlic powder)
  * 1/2 to 1 tsp salt
  * 2 tbsp olive oil (optional)

Put all ingredients except for the olive oil and tahini in the bowl and blend until fine.  Next, add tahini and olive oil and blend again.  To serve, spread on a plate and garnish with whole chick peas or roasted pine nuts, olive oil, parsley, a dash of paprika and/or cayenne pepper.

The secret to my version of this recipe is to add the tahini and olive oil at the end of blending.  This not only puts less strain on your food processor, but gives you a creamier, more consistent final product.

Happy hummus making!
