**Do you have a specific set of webpages that you browse to every day?**

I do.  I used to have all of these sites bookmarked and placed into specific news folders in Firefox or Safari.  Right-clicking on a folder would present the option to 'Open All in Tabs' and all of my favorites would be right there for me to filter through.  This was easy to setup and I had all of my regular pages a couple of clicks away.  This system, while it works, has a couple of flaws, the most annoying of which is you have to actually browse to the page in order to determine if it has been updated or not.

**Enter RSS**

Recently I discovered the power of RSS along with RSS readers.  This changes the 'pull' system I was used into a much more manageable and easily aggregated 'push' system.  Now, when I want to check the news, I go to [Google Reader](https://reader.google.com) and all of these favorites are organized by tags.  Each tag shows how many unread stories I have right at the top and clicking on a tag gives the aggregated feed with my unread stories on top, making it easy to see what's new.

**Why Google Reader?**

Now, I'll be the first to admit that Google's RSS reader is not the easiest to use.  However, once you get a feel for how it works, it's much better then most (all?) of the other RSS readers out there on the Mac.  The 2 that come closest are [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/) and [NewsFire](http://www.newsfirerss.com/), both of which have issues.

NetNewsWire offers syncing with Google Reader, which is nice.  However, the interface is pretty bad and I've heard some [horror](http://www.subtraction.com/2009/08/01/netnewswires-stinkin-synching) [stories](http://www.snappytheclam.com/archives/000930.html) about syncing with Google Reader.

NewsFire, on the other hand, has an excellent interface, which makes it easy to use.  However, it doesn't offer any syncing capabilities.  This is a deal-breaker for me as I browse the Interwebs both at work as well as on 2 machines at home.

**Sticking with Google Reader**

If you are someone who generally browses on 1 machine, I would highly suggest NewsFire.  Until NewsFire adds some kind of syncing support (hopefully with Google Reader), I'm sticking with Google Reader, which isn't a bad thing.
