For quite a while I've struggled with a 'strict' NAT when connecting to XBox Live.  I've finally fixed this problem.  Apparently, [BE](https://www.bethere.co.uk/) locks down their Speedtouch routers which creates this problem.  The fix is simple:

On top of this, you may need to forward some ports on your router:

When I get some time, I will try to confirm the need for mapping ports.
