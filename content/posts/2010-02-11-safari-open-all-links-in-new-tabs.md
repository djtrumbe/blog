In trying to migrate from Firefox to Safari on all of my Macs, one thing that has bothered me is the inability to do 1-window browsing (i.e. opening all links in new tabs instead of new windows). After scouring the interwebs, I am still unable to accomplish this in Safari v4.0.4 and Mac OS v10.6.2.  Even though there are [multiple](https://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200812/make_safari_open_targeted_links_in_new_tabs_instead_of_new_windows/) [blog](http://www.switchingtomac.com/tutorials/how-to-force-safari-4-to-open-links-in-a-new-tab-instead-of-a-new-window/) [posts](https://www.engadget.com/2008-09-08-terminal-tips-force-safari-to-open-all-links-in-new-tab.html) out there explaining a simple solution, it doesn't seem to work on any of my machines.  Lastly, I know that [SafariStand](https://github.com/anakinsk/SafariStand) <!-- legacy link: http://hetima.com/safari/stand-e.html //--> exists, but it seems both hacky and overkill for what I'm trying to accomplish.

Does anyone have a simple solution for this or know why the solution mentioned all over the web doesn't work?

**UPDATE**

Pie in my face...  Under "Safari->Preferences->General" there is an option "Open links from applications" and setting that to "in a new tab in the current window" is the exactly what I was looking for ([reference](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=863463&highlight=safari+open+links+new+tab)).  D'oh!
