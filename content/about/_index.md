Hey all!  Iâ€™m a CS major, turned Application Support person who works in the trading industry for Chicago Trading Company.  My wife, Faye, and I moved to London in late 2007, where we live and work now.

Some of my interests include brewing beer, programming in Python, watching sports and TV and hanging out with friends.
